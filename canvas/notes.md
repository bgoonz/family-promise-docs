# Notes

## Objectives in Labs

### What are Objectives?

Instead of Sprint Challenges, Labs uses **Objectives** to assess your understanding and your contributions to your project.

Objectives are your ticket to graduationâ€”achieve them all, and you'll be ready to graduate! \(Note that it will take a minimum of four sprints to achieve all your objectives, and you'll have up to eight sprints to do it.\)

Your objectives are tailored to your roleâ€”another way to arm you with an experience more relevant to you.

### Objective Types

Here's an example set of objectives:

![List of Labs objectives:

- \[ \]  Attend at least two Stakeholder Meetings for your product
- \[ \]  Attend at least two Product Reviews for your product
- \[ \]  Attend at least four Design Critique sessions
- \[ \]  Pass \`Labs\` course
- \[ \]  Pass \`Labs: UX Engineer\` course
- \[ \]  Pass \`Career Readiness\` course
- \[ \]  Peer-review at least six teammates on Searchlight
- \[ \]  Submit at least six qualified pull requests
- \[ \]  Review at least 10 pull requests from your team
- \[ \]  Have at least one pull request merged](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1544/files/384468/preview)

Note that generally, there are a few types of objectives:

* Pass a course in Canvas
* Attend meetings
* Submit or review pull requests
* Peer-review teammates in Searchlight
* Other \(role-specific\)

## How to Use This Course

This course houses and tracks all your objectives in Labs. You can visit it throughout Labs to track your progress toward graduation.

You'll find multiple modules in this course: this **Introduction** \(you are here!\), **Graduation Objectives** for your role, and **Sprint Milestones**.

At any time, you can return to view all the modules by clicking `Modules` in the left course menu.

### Graduation Objectives

The module right after the Introduction contains your objectivesâ€”pass these, and you're eligible to pass Labs.

You'll notice these are in the form of "assignments," but they can't be submitted. All your objectives will be tracked and/or verified for you, and reflected here.

You'll also notice points assigned to each objectiveâ€”don't worry about those, as they'll be used internally by staff as a normalized measure of progress.

### Sprint Milestones

The other modules are Sprint Milestonesâ€”together, **they're a roadmap laying out a path to achieve all your objectives in four sprints.**

Each of these modules contains some bits of activity that will contribute toward your overall objectives.

![Example Sprint Milestones for Sprint 1](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1544/files/384469/preview)

For example, the above set of sprint milestones recommends what you'd need to do during your first sprint in Labs to stay on track to pass after four sprints.

`Labs: Labs 101` means "Complete the module called `Labs 101` in the `Labs` course in Canvas."

Similarly, `Technical Project Manager: Training` means "Complete the module called `Training` in the `Labs: Technical Project Manager` course in Canvas."

Use these sprint milestones as a guide to ensure you're on pace to achieve your objectives.

Reach out to your Release Manager at any time for questions about achieving or tracking your objectives.

Happy achieving! ðŸš€
