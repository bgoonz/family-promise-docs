# Seven Principles of Design

## Seven Principles of Design

There are really _lots_ of useful ways to categorize and talk about design. You could come up with any arbitrary way of grouping these topics together, listing them out, and exploring them.

For our purposes, we're going to focus on **seven principles of design** that combine to give us a solid foundation for approaching problems:

1. Unity
2. Balance
3. Alignment
4. Hierarchy
5. Emphasis
6. Proportion
7. White Space

In this module, we'll dive into each of these design principles. We'll refer to each of them throughout the rest of this course, during our Design Critiques, and throughout Labs.
