# Design Critiques

## 

### What are Design Critiques?

In Design Critiques, UX Engineers meet with the Design Manager at least once per sprint to present their design progress and planning for group discussion.

### Our Goals

**Go Deeper on Core Design Concepts**

These sessions are an opportunity to empower you with a more nuanced understanding of UI/UX that you can **carry into interviews**.

**Reinforce the Curriculum**

By walking through active projects together throughout development, we'll naturally encounter **clear, real-world case studies** that provide examples of best practices.

**Level Up Your Product's Quality**

Design Critiques are a great opportunity to practice **giving and receiving feedback** in the context of team development.

### Agenda

#### Pick Volunteers

We'll pick on a few UX Engineers to walk us through what they're working on!

#### Design Lead Presentations

**Introduction**

Each UX Engineer on the presenting team should give a _very brief_ introduction of themselves and their design experience, then they should introduce their product to provide context.

**Product Demo**

With someone sharing their screen, the UX Engineer should collaboratively walk through either the live deployed version or a relevant local version of the product. The Design Manager facilitates a group discussion identifying aspects of the product demonstrating good UI/UX principles as well as aspects needing improvement.

**Planning Artifact Presentation**

With someone sharing their screen, the Design Leads should collaboratively walk through any design planning artifacts they've got \(e.g. user flows, wireframes\). The Design Manager facilitates a group discussion about the artifacts, the general design direction, and UI/UX concerns relevant to their product.

Now read on to see how **Product Reviews** work in Labs.
