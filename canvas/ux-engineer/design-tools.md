# Design Tools

## Design Tools in Labs

As a UX Engineer, you'll be using various industry tools to generate and maintain **design artifacts** \(things you create for use by your team\).

### Whimsical

[Whimsical \(Links to an external site.\)](https://whimsical.com/) is a diagramming and rapid prototyping tool you can use to create flowcharts, wireframes, mind maps, sticky notes, and docs.

You'll mostly use Whimsical to create **user flows** and **wireframes**.

**User Flows** are flowcharts showing a user's path through your productâ€”what decisions they make, actions they take, and what screens and features they use along the way. They provide a map \(really, a graph\) showing all the possible paths.

**Wireframes** are quick, lightweight sketches of the basic layout of each page, view, or feature in your product.
