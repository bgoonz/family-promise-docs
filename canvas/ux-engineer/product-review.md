# Product Review

## Product Reviews

### What are Product Reviews?

In Product Reviews, all teams on each product and that product's Release Manager meet with Labs managers near the end of each sprint to present progress, blockers, and a path forward.

In Labs, each product is assigned one or more teams. The teams on each product all work on the same active codebase.

The goal of a Product Review is to more closely track each team's progress in the context of their product, and devote high-bandwidth time to meet as a group, provide direct feedback, and facilitate discussions.

Product Reviews are facilitated by all Labs managers for each product, every sprint.

### Agenda

#### Pick Volunteers

We'll pick on a few teams to walk us through what they're working on!

#### Walkthroughs

Each team will share their screen and briefly demo their progressâ€”preferably via a running application, but also potentially design artifacts.

As a **UX Engineer**, you'll be in charge of presenting what your team's been working on with design, including any relevant user flows, wireframes, mockups, or other diagrams or planning artifacts.

Labs Managers will provide holistic critiques to move each team forward.
