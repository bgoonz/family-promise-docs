## What are Design Systems?

A **design system** is a comprehensive recipe of the user-facing elements that will make up a product.

You can think of a design system as a **single source of truth** for all the design-related things that go into designing and building a product.

At the core, a design system will contain **definitions of components** \(technical documentation\) and information on **how those components will be used** \(functional documentation\).

A design system can include a one or more design languages, style guides, and pattern libraries.

It can also include things like:

* brand/identity standards
* values
* objectives
* best practices for accessibility
