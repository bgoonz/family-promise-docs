# What's Inclusive Design?

## What's Inclusive Design?

**Inclusive design** is a philosophy that a product should be "accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible ... without the need for special adaptation or specialized design" \([British Standards Institute \(Links to an external site.\)](https://shop.bsigroup.com/products/design-management-systems-managing-inclusive-design-guide?pid=000000000030142267), 2005\).

In short, we shouldn't need to adapt products after the fact to handle certain "special" groups of users \(e.g., those with visual impairments, those with low language or tech literacy\). Instead, we should try to design our product, from the start, to accommodate them in a first-class way.

### Designing Inclusively

Inclusive design _doesn't_ mean we'll be able to design perfectly for every single person who might use our product. After all, it would be impossible to anticipate every possible way in with people might differ and in which their experience with a product might be affected.

Instead, we can only do our best to make an effort to _understand the diversity_ of our potential users as we develop our product, and apply that understanding to our design.

We can then consciously incorporate different ways for users to interact with our product.

And then regardless, we should make it easy to adapt or extend our product for those we weren't initially able to design for.

For example, Microsoft's [resources on inclusive design \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) lays out three principles of inclusive design:

* Recognize exclusion
* Solve for one, extend to many
* Learn from diversity

If we designed a product based on simply our own perspective and abilities, we'd be producing a product biased heavily toward people just like us. What about the rest? What factors might you consider?
