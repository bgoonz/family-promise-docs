## Building Inclusively and Accessibly



As a designer, you also need to understand **how your designs will be implemented**. That means developing deep insight into how your product will be built.

As a UX designer, in some contexts, you might not write any code—you'll develop detailed processes and designs and hand them off to engineers. In other contexts, you might write a significant amount of code, bringing your designs to fruition largely by yourself. Regardless, if you're going to be working on a team, you'll need to set the vision and direction for how you'll design inclusively and build for usability—and work to ensure your design solutions are indeed achievable for a wide variety of users.

Here are some great resources to reference as you design and build products to ensure you're incorporating accessibility from the ground up:

* [W3C provides a wide variety of information and resources (Links to an external site.)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/) for building accessibly on the web.
  * **The W3C's **[**Web Contrast Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (Links to an external site.)**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)** are something you should reference throughout Labs to continuously audit your product's accessibility!**
* This [article by Smashing Magazine (Links to an external site.)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/complete-guide-accessible-front-end-components/) compiles a long list of of ways to build accessible frontend components.
