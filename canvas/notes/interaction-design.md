# Interaction Design

## Interaction Design

**Interaction design** \(IxD\) is another subset of UX that focuses on **the junction between the user and the product.**

IxD tries to answer questions like:

* How is a user inclined to interact with a product under certain circumstances?
* How do we _want_ our users to interact with a particular product?
* How do we drive user interactions to achieve product goals?
* How can we build something that lets users accomplish their goals in an optimal way?

### The Five Dimensions Framework of Interaction Design

In 2007, [Kevin Silver \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/07/what-puts-the-design-in-interaction-design.php) adapted [Gillian Crampton Smith's \(Links to an external site.\)](http://feiramoderna.net/download/pos-positivo/MOGGRIDGE-Bill/DesigningInteractions_00_foreword.pdf) four "dimensions" of interaction design "languages" to add a fifth dimension, giving rise to the "Five Dimensions" framework:

| Dimension \# | Dimension | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-D | Words | Words are themselves interactions, and should be used with care. |
| 2-D | Visual Representations | Typography, diagrams, icons, and other graphics with which users interact. |
| 3-D | Physical Objects or Space | Objects with which or spaces within which users interact in the "real world". |
| 4-D | Time | The time within which users interact \(with content that changes over time\). |
| 5-D | Behavior | Action and reaction, including how users interact with the product. |

These dimensions define different ways that users can interact with a productâ€”often all at once. They might be helpful to consider as your build a product, because they'll force you to be conscious of the fact that users will constantly have an impression along each dimension.
