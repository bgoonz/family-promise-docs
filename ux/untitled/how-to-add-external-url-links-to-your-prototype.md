**Part #3 of a 5 part series: prototyping with Anima in Sketch**

With Anima, you can build prototypes that feel real Directly inside Sketch, Adobe XD, or Figma, and start free!

#### External Links in Prototypes

Add links to any text layer within your design file to:

* Direct collaborators to external sites like documentation and project management tools.
* Create navigation within a large Figma file to specific frames and pages.
* Link to other Figma files and prototypes.
* Represent actual links that will exist in production.

Note: It's not currently possible to add links to images or vector objects in the Editor, only when [creating prototype hotspots](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040315773#The_Anatomy_of_a_Connection). Linking to default email clients using HTML like mailto: is not supported at this time.

## Create a link <a href="create_a_link" id="create_a_link"></a>

You can add a link to an entire text layer, or to a selection of text within the layer. Select the text layer, then press the Enter key to edit the text layer and make your selection.

### Create link icon <a href="create_link_icon" id="create_link_icon"></a>

1. Make your selection.
2. Click the create link icon in the toolbar:

Keep in mind, you will need to edit both the text layer and the URL to make any changes.

## Copy links to Files, Pages, and Frames <a href="copy_links_to_files-_pages-_and_frames" id="copy_links_to_files-_pages-_and_frames"></a>

Create navigation links to pages and frames within a large file, or link out to other Figma files and prototypes.

To find the link for your destination:

### File <a href="file" id="file"></a>

1. Open the file in the Editor.
2. Click the **Share** button and set [Link Sharing permissions](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040531773).

### Prototype <a href="prototype" id="prototype"></a>

1. Open the file in the Editor.
2. Click the **Present** button  to open the prototype in [presentation view](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040318013).
3. Click the **Share Prototype** button and set [Link Sharing permissions](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040531773).

1. Hover over the linked text to preview the link.
2. Click **Open Link** to follow the link: 
3. What happens when you follow the linked text will depend on the type of link:
   * **Figma file or prototype:** Figma will open links to other Figma files and prototypesâ€”or frames and pages within themâ€”in a new tab.
   * **Page or frame:** Figma will take you to the page or frame in the current file.
   * **External website:** Figma will open all external links in a new tab. The first time you open a link, you'll need to confirm that you're leaving Figma.
