### Visibility of system status

The system should keep users informed through appropriate feedback within reasonable time

### Match between system and the real world

The system should speak the users' language rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions

### User control and freedom

Users often make mistakes and need 'emergency exits' to leave the unwanted state. Support undo and redo

### Consistency and standards

Users shouldn't have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions

### Error prevention

Prevent problems from occuring in the first place, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action

### Recognition rather than recall

Minimize memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. Instructions should be visible or easily retrievable

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user. Allow users to tailor frequent actions

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed

### Help recognize & recover from errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language, indicate the problem, and suggest a solution

### Help and documentation

Any necessary help documentation should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large

## UX Patterns

### UX Patterns: Modeling an Experience

Once we narrow our focus to UI/UX, the difference between a UX pattern and a UI pattern becomes subtle. Why is that?

Think about our definition of _pattern_—a recipe for a solution to a common problem.

So much of what we design and build for a user experience is via a user interface. So naturally, a pattern to solve a _user experience_ problem will often involve a _user interface_ pattern.

But let's start by considering the general ways we can understand and start to model a user _experience_—the knowledge we have about what drives positive product experiences.

### Jakob's Law

In 2000, Jakob Nielsen of the Nielsen Norman Group [posited (Links to an external site.)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/):

> **Users spend most of their time on **_**other**_** sites.** This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

Note that Nielsen isn't just talking about the way websites _look_—he's referring to how they _work_. In other words, in general, a user's experience with a website will be better if they don't have to learn new ways to interact with it. What's the takeaway here? **Use UX patterns!**

Naturally, there's [some controversy (Links to an external site.)](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/jakobs-law-e368d03c7636) about taking Jakob's Law to its absolute conclusion. If we all want users to avoid having to experience different sites differently, then will all websites end up exactly the same?

Nonetheless, when you're designing a product and thinking about your user's experience, it can be a very useful rule of thumb: _**don't reinvent the wheel**_. Default to the "boring" way to let your user experience your product—_then_ think about ways to tweak that experience if it makes sense for your product's goals.

### The Hook Model

In his influential 2014 book _Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products_, Nir Eyal proposed [**the Hook Model (Links to an external site.)**](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/).

The Hook model divides a user's interaction and experience with a product into four phases:

1. A trigger to start using it
2. An action that "satisfies" the trigger
3. A reward for the action
4. An "investment" that makes the product more valuable to the user

Taken together, these phases of the Hook Model are a UX pattern. We're predicting ways that users will become engaged with our product via an experience we can engineer.

One thing to note here, however—the Hook Model focuses on optimizing products for _engagement_—it doesn't necessarily optimize products for _quality_. In any case, though, keep it in mind as a valuable way to build a product experience that will keep users coming back.

### Gamification

**Gamification** is incorporating game-like reward features into a product that isn't nominally a game.

One example of gamification is the Wikimedia Foundation's [donation badges (Links to an external site.)](https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:DonationBadges)—users who donate get recognized with a public badge (this also incorporates another useful concept: **social proof**—giving your users examples of other people using your product in a certain way to encourage them to do so, too). Another frequent example is giving users points for completing certain actions, like filling in their profile information.

To drive positive product experiences, you'll want to ensure you're **motivating** your users, not manipulating them—and that you're not relying on gamification alone to make the user experience great.

### The List Goes On...

There are hundreds of UX patterns out there, like:

* ways to give feedback to the user
* ways to increase or decrease choices for the user
* ways to rely on or assist users' memory

If you want to read more about UX patterns, check out [**Laws of UX (Links to an external site.)**](https://lawsofux.com), a really cool site laying out a bunch of research-driven UX principles and best practices.

We've barely scratched the surface—but hopefully, these examples give you an idea of the work that has been done to understand user experiences, and to synthesize that knowledge into formulas for product success.

## UI Patterns

### UI Patterns: Implementing Paradigms

Now that we've examined general approaches to user experience problems, we can take some of those **paradigms**—models for thinking about things—and see how we can implement them via user interfaces.

### Common UI Patterns

These frequently-used UI patterns combine structure, organization, and interaction behavior to meet users where they are and provide predictable, minimum-friction experiences. You'll almost certainly immediately recognize them!

#### Pagination

**Pagination** is splitting content up into pages. These aren't necessary separate screens or webpages—you'll usually deal with pagination when you're working with tables:

![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-29%20at%208.27.19%20PM.png](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1562/files/388983/preview)

Pagination helps us avoid putting too much information in front of our users at once.

Note that to implement pagination, your product will often need to adjust the way it queries a database—we'll probably only want to retrieve the "page" of data we're interested in displaying. This is called **query pagination**. Pagination is thus a great example of how designing a user interface based on a user experience can result in a full-stack engineering feature—the frontend and the backend will need to accommodate paginated queries in order to present this experience to the user.

#### Progressive Disclosure

**Progressive disclosure** is waiting to show content and/or prompt the user for action until it's needed. As the user continues toward a goal, they complete the process gradually. Pagination is an example of progressive disclosure!

Another example of progressive disclosure is using **lazy forms**—forms whose fields only appear once the user has filled in the previous field (or set of fields):

![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-29%20at%208.35.39%20PM.png](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1562/files/388984/preview)

A related concept is using **wizards**—walking the user through a process, with input fields or other required actions showing over multiple pages or screens:

![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-29%20at%208.39.19%20PM.png](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1562/files/388985/preview)

Progressive disclosure prevents users from being intimidated by having to go through a lot of information or perform a lot of actions at once.

#### Breadcrumbs

**Breadcrumbs** are a very common UI pattern where we display a "secondary" navigation system to the user based on where they are in a hierarchy of pages or screens.

Note the breadcrumbs below (`New Items` → `Popular` → `On Sale`):

![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-29%20at%208.46.56%20PM.png](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1562/files/388986/preview)

Breadcrumbs both **orient the user** and allow them to **navigate in context**.

In order to be usefully orienting, breadcrumbs should be based on the actual page or screen hierarchy (the way the content is actually organized) rather than whatever way the user has happened to navigate around (their **history**). That's because showing the hierarchy gives the user more information about how your product's content is structured.

#### Empty States

**Empty states** are an extremely useful pattern that tells the user: "There's nothing here _right now_—but there could be!"

![Screen%20Shot%202021-08-29%20at%208.52.28%20PM.png](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/1562/files/388987/preview)

Empty states are highly orienting for users, because it tells them both how they should be interacting with your product, and what to expect both in the short term and the long term.

If your users will land on a screen where data _could_ be displayed, but there currently isn't anything to show them—you'll _almost certainly_ want to show them an empty state.

## Accessibility:

This checklist uses [The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) as a reference point. The WCAG is a shared standard for web content accessibility for individuals, organizations, and governments.

There are three levels of accessibility compliance in the WCAG, which reflect the priority of support:

![](https://www.a11yproject.com/img/checklist/wcag-level-a-small.svg)

A: EssentialIf this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.

![](https://www.a11yproject.com/img/checklist/wcag-level-aa-small.svg)

AA: Ideal SupportRequired for [multiple government and public body websites](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/). The A11Y Project strives for AA compliance.

![](https://www.a11yproject.com/img/checklist/wcag-level-aaa-small.svg)

AAA: Specialized SupportThis is typically reserved for parts of websites and web apps that serve a specialized audience.

This checklist targets many, but not all level A and AA concerns. Note that the different levels of WCAG support do not necessarily indicate an increased level of difficulty to implement.

### Success criteria

Each item on this checklist has a corresponding WCAG "success criterion." Success criterion are the specific, testable rules that power the WCAG, described by a reference number and short title. For example, the rule about text resizing is called [1.4.4 Resize text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html).

Some accessibility issues may have multiple success criterion apply to them. We have identified the one most relevant for each checklist item.

### Does this checklist guarantee my site is accessible?

No. However, addressing the issues called out in this checklist will help improve the experience for everyone who uses your site.

The issues this checklist prompts you to check for covers a wide range of disability conditions. There is no such thing as "perfect accessibility" or a site being "100% accessible." You should be wary of companies and services that make such promises. If you need professional accessibility help, use [professional accessibility services](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#professional-help).

### Content

Content is the most important part of your site.

Make sure that decorative images use null `alt` (empty) attribute values.

[1.1.1 NON-TEXT CONTENT](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html)

Null `alt` attributes are also sometimes known as empty `alt` attributes. They are made by including no information between the opening and closing quotes of an `alt` attribute. Decorative images do not communicate information that is required to understand the website's overall meaning. Historically they were used for flourishes and [spacer gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacer_GIF) images, but tend to be less relevant for modern websites and web apps.

[The order of heading elements](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-importance-of-heading-levels-for-assistive-technology--cms-31753) should descend, based on the "depth" of the content. For example, a `h4` element should not appear on a page before the first `h3` element declaration. A tool such as [headingsMap](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#headingsmap) can help you evaluate this.

Use the `a` element for links.

[1.3.1 INFO AND RELATIONSHIPS](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html)

Links should always have a `href` attribute, even when used in Single Page Applications (SPAs). Without a `href` attribute, the link will not be properly exposed to assistive technology. An example of this would be a link that uses an `onclick` event, in place of a `href` attribute.
