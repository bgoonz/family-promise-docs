* [Design Flexible Cards with Figma](https://medium.com/p/design-flexible-cards-with-figma-a80aada2646f)

I wrote many articles about this feature and I think it’s not necessary to have another article for it. So, I just refer you to those articles which would be helpful:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/27/0\*LnN30d7bHnEMDoV0.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/545/0\*LnN30d7bHnEMDoV0.png)If you read my articles, you will learn how to design the default messenger of iOS on Figma using the “Auto-Layout” feature.

## 9- Auto-Layout <a href="d992" id="d992"></a>

Watch the above .gif to learn this trick.

Figma was the first design tool which allowed designers to set the space between different elements automatically, It doesn’t matter if the layers are aligned vertically or horizontally!

## 8- Define The Space Between Different Elements <a href="0e5b" id="0e5b"></a>

Hold the “Shift” button and try to draw your desired object. This trick works if you want to draw squares or circles (Not Ovals!).

## 7- Create Objects with Equal Height and Width <a href="1369" id="1369"></a>

![](https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/27/0\*XscPDecc6A5-CvIk.gif?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0\*XscPDecc6A5-CvIk.gif)

Follow the below .gif to learn this trick:

One of the most important things for designers who work on dashboards or analytical tools is the ability to create semi-circles. Figma allows you to do this easily.

## 6- Create Semi-Circles / Circular Progress Bars <a href="9794" id="9794"></a>

![](https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/27/0\*UOllDTx4LRwtA26w.gif?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0\*UOllDTx4LRwtA26w.gif)

There a few plugins for Figma which allow you to find similar layers and apply changes to them. But if you are looking to reduce your usage to 3rd-plugins, you can find similar layers easily by heading to **Edit / Select all …**. There different options which you can use to select similar text styles together or select similar layers with the same properties.

## **5- Find Similar Layers Without Plugins!** <a href="ecb9" id="ecb9"></a>

> We use same style of naming for colours. For example,** Sort the colors based on their usage:**\
> Buttons — Blue / Buttons — Red / Alert — Yellow / Texts — Black / Texts- Black (70%)

![](https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/27/0\*vy7b62kmphVvpH2f.gif?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0\*vy7b62kmphVvpH2f.gif)

and the result would be something like this on Figma:

Roboto / Body

Roboto / Headline 1

SF Pro / Body

SF Pro / Headline 1

Now, we want to sort these text styles based on their font family. This is how we do it:

**Body — 16 px:** SF text / Roboto

**Headline 1–36 px :**SF Pro / Roboto

Imagine we have these text styles:

This trick works for designers who think about having a design system or creating a UI kit for their projects. As Sketch does, Figma allows you to sort your text styles by grouping them using “/”.

## **4- Sort Font Styles / Color Styles** <a href="3869" id="3869"></a>

* Double-click on the layer’s name will allow you to change the name of the layer!

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0\*aGOQSFEE3cIh7Xx4.gif)

If you have worked on a design system, you probably have some problems to find layers. On Figma, you just need to double-click on the layer’s thumbnail to find it:

## 3- Locate Layers <a href="04ab" id="04ab"></a>

To move an object easily and on a straight line, just hold “Shift” button on your keyboard and then try to relocate it. By doing this, Figma will limit you to the vertical axis or horizontal axis.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/540/0\*5DYJ44fJSSWLqytk.gif)

If you are one of the designers who play with pixels to draw a straight line, you need to learn this trick. Just select the “Pen Tool” or “Line” and hold “Shift” button on your keyboard. Now, you can draw a straight line easily!

## 2- Draw Straight Lines / Move Objects on a Straight Line <a href="1971" id="1971"></a>

File → Place Images and then select the images. Now, click on the shapes and Figma will fill shapes with images automatically.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/540/0\*1qkHFwhHE_IqmtiW.gif)

Follow these steps:

Imagine you want to fill different shapes with multiple images at once. Beginners will start filling shapes one by one but professionals will use the “Batch Image Import” feature which Figma provides.

In this article, we will learn the most useful shortcuts of Figma which can speed up your workflow.

Hello again, It’s Em!

Figma is one of the amazing design tools and if you use it as your daily design app, you need to learn its shortcuts which speeds up your workflow.

Introduction

Welcome to Figma, the world's first collaborative interface design tool. Figma allows designers to create and prototype their digital experiences - together in real-time and in one place - helping them turn their ideas and visions into products, faster. Figma's mission is to make design accessible to everyone. The Figma API is one of the ways we aim to do that.What can I do with the Figma API?

The Figma API supports read access and interactions with Figma files. This gives you the ability to view and extract any objects or layers, and their properties, so you can render them as images outside of Figma. You can then present your designs, connect them to other applications, or use them to expand on your vision. Future versions of the API will unlock even greater functionality around Files.How does it work?

The Figma API is based on the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) structure. We support authentication via [access tokens](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens) and [OAuth2](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#oauth2). Requests are made via HTTP endpoints with clear functions and appropriate response codes. Endpoints allow you to request [files](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#files), [images](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-images-endpoint), [file versions](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#version-history), [users](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#users), [comments](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#comments), [team projects](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-team-projects-endpoint) and [project files](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-project-files-endpoint).

Once granted access, you can use the Figma API to inspect a JSON representation of the file. Every layer or object in a file will be represented within the file by a node (subtree). You will then be able to access and isolate the object and any properties associated with it. In addition to accessing files and layers, you will be able to GET and POST comments to files.Getting started

If you’re not already using Figma, the first step is to sign up and create an account [over here.](https://www.figma.com/signup)

Once you have a Figma account, the next step is to authenticate with the API. This can be done using either [OAuth2](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#oauth2) or [access tokens](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens).

You can then browse our endpoints and start making queries against the Figma API. We recommend starting with the basics by learning about [Figma files](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#files), before moving on to more advanced topics such as [comments](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#comments), [users](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#users), [version history](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#version-history), and [projects](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#projects).

If you plan on building a fully-fledged app, that others can share and use, then you can register your app by heading to [My apps](https://www.figma.com/developers/apps) in your Figma account.Base URLhttps://api.figma.comAuthentication

Before you can access an endpoint within Figma, you will need to provide valid authentication. You can authenticate your request to the Figma API in two ways:

1. Generate a personal access token through your user profile page. This gives you access to the Figma API as if you were a single user.
2. Recommended: register a callback via OAuth2 and collect a client secret. This allows you non-specific access to the Figma API, without having to act on behalf of a specific user.

Access tokensA personal access token gives the holder access to an account through the API as if they were the user who generated the token.Generate a personal access token

1. Login to your Figma account.
2. Head to the account settings from the top-left menu inside Figma.
3. Find the personal access tokens section.
4. Click Create new token.
5. A token will be generated. This will be your only chance to copy the token, so make sure you keep a copy of this in a secure place.

From the account settings page, you will also be able to see when the token was last used (give or take a few minutes). If you see any activity on a token that you did not initiate, revoke the token immediately. Revocations are instant and can be made at any time.

You can also generate an access token from this page to explore our endpoints. The token generated here functions exactly the same as a token generated from the account settings page as in the instructions above.Use the personal access token

You can now use the token to make requests to the Figma API. You can do so by passing the token to the API in the header of your request. We’ve shown you an example of how this would look.

The name of the token header is X-Figma-Token.+ Get personal access token[What's this?](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens)Using the token to make requests

```
$ curl -sH 'X-Figma-Token: 29-206...'

}
```

OAuth 2[OAuth 2](https://oauth.net/2/) is a web security protocol that allows 3rd party applications to establish a link between a user’s account and their access to a given API, on behalf of that user. We support OAuth 2 authentication in addition to personal access tokens. You would use OAuth 2 when you would like to access the Figma API, without having to identify yourself as a specific user.

To get started with OAuth 2:

1. [Register an application via your Figma account.](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#register-oauth2)
2. [Authenticate any users.](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#auth-oauth2)
3. [Use the OAuth 2 Token.](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#token-oauth2)
4. [Refresh an OAuth 2 Token.](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#refresh-oauth2)

Register an Application

Registering an app establishes a link between your existing Figma user account(s) and your application, which allows you to access data via the Figma API on the user's behalf.

1. Head to the [My apps](https://www.figma.com/developers/apps) tab to get started.
2. In the Registered apps section, click Create a new app.
3. You’ll then need to complete some details about your application:
   1. Enter the name and website for your app.
   2. Upload a logo for your application users will be able to see this).
   3. Specify the Callback. This can be any endpoint/URL of your choosing. You must specify at least one callback and only callbacks appearing in this list will be allowed to receive the access token.
   4. \\
   5. What is a Callback?
   6. When a user attempts to allow your application access to the API, our authentication servers will make a request (a Callback) to the endpoint you specified, with the access token included.
4. Click Save to create the app.
5. You will be given your client ID and client secret. This will allow you to access the Figma API. The client secret will only be shown to you once! Copy it now and store it someplace safe.![](https://www.figma.com/images/developer_app/oauth2.png)

You’re now ready to authenticate users via your app!

Authenticate users

To authenticate any users, ask them to visit the following URL:

```bash
GET https://www.figma.com/oauth?
  client_id=:client_id&
  redirect_uri=:callback&
  scope=file_read&
  state=:state&
  response_type=code
```

Important: this URL must be accessed via the user's browser and not an embedded webview inside your application. Webview access to the Figma OAuth flow is not supported and may stop working for some or all users without an API version update.

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| client_id     | The client ID for your app. In the example Pencil app above, the client ID is fGd5TpaewrbjLdsrGO33AP.                                                                                                                                |
| redirect_uri  | This must be one of the values you set as your callbacks in the app creation/edit screen. The auth page will call this URI if the user allows access to your app.                                                                    |
| scope         | Currently this value can only be file_read signifying read-only access to the user's files.                                                                                                                                          |
| state         | This is a value that you should randomly generate and store. When we call back to your callback endpoint, you should check that the state value we pass back to you matches the state value that you initially used in your request. |
| response_type | Currently we only support the authorization code flow for OAuth 2, so the only valid value here is code. We may support other values in the future.                                                                                  |

Once the user navigates to this address, they will see a screen like the following:![](https://www.figma.com/images/developer_app/oauth3.png)

If the user rejects the request, no callback is triggered.

At this point, the client will be redirected to the callback that was passed as redirect_uri.If the redirect URI that was provided is https://example.com/oauth/callback, then the expected callback request would look like: https://example.com/oauth/callback?code=:code\&state=:state

* :code here refers to the authentication code that can be traded in for an access token.
* :state refers to the state variable that was in the initial url given to the user.

Please check that the state parameter passed back to you is the same as the one originally generated.

Now the code can be passed back to the OAuth API to get the user's access token:

```bash
POST https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/token?
  client_id=:client_id&
  client_secret=:client_secret&
  redirect_uri=:callback&
  code=:code&
  grant_type=authorization_code

{
  "access_token": <TOKEN>,
  "expires_in": <EXPIRATION (in seconds)>,
  "refresh_token": <REFRESH TOKEN>
}
```

* :callback must match the redirect URI originally provided, and code must match the authentication code provided to your callback.
* :client_secret is the secret key that you copied when you created your application.

If the parameters match, you will receive the user access token and token expiration (in seconds) in a JSON response.Using the OAuth 2 Token

Once you have obtained the user access token, using it is very similar to the way you use [personal access tokens.](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens)

When you call the API, pass a Bearer authorization header like so:

```bash
$ curl -sH 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'
    'https://api.figma.com/v1/files/...'
    | python -m json.tool
{
  "components": {},
  "document": {
    "children": [
      {
        "backgroundColor": {
          "a": 1,
          "b": 0.8980392156862745,
          "g": 0.8980392156862745,
          "r": 0.8980392156862745
        },
        "children": [],
        "exportSettings": [],
        "id": "0:1",
        "name": "Page 1",
        "type": "CANVAS",
        "visible": true
      }
    ],
    "id": "0:0",
    "name": "Document",
    "type": "DOCUMENT",
    "visible": true
  },
  "schemaVersion": 0
}
```

Refreshing OAuth tokens

By default OAuth tokens expire after 90 days so you will need to refresh your stored tokens if your integration is long-lived. You do this using the refresh_token.

Your refresh_token can be reused as many times as necessary to retrieve a new access_token. This requires you to POST a request to refresh the token, based on its current expiry date. Here’s how that looks:

```
POST https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/refresh?
  client_id=:client_id&
  client_secret=:client_secret&
  refresh_token=:refresh_token

{
  "access_token": <TOKEN>,
  "expires_in": <EXPIRATION (in seconds)>,
}
```

Figma files

Every file in Figma consists of a tree of nodes. At the root of every file is a DOCUMENT node, and from that node stems any CANVAS nodes. Every canvas node represents a PAGE in a Figma file. A canvas node can then have any number of nodes as its children. Each subtree stemming from a canvas node will represent a layer (e.g an object) on the canvas.

Nodes have a number of properties associated with them. Some of these are global properties, that exist on every node, whereas other node properties will be specific to the type of node.Global propertiesThe following are properties that exist on every node. These give us some basic information about identifying and viewing the node.

| Node type | Properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Node typesNode type indicates what kind of node you are working with: for example, a FRAME node versus a RECTANGLE node. A node can have additional properties associated with it depending on its node type. The following is a catalog of properties that can be applied to a node, grouped by node type.

The first position corresponds to the start of the gradient (value 0 for the purposes of calculating gradient stops), the second position is the end of the gradient (value 1), and the third handle position determines the width of the gradient.

EndpointsFiles endpoints allow for a wide range of functionality to get information about files. With a specific file key, you can get the JSON and image representations of the whole file or individual nodes within the file.GET file

Returns the document refered to by :key as a JSON object. The file key can be parsed from any Figma file url: https://www.figma.com/file/:key/:title. The name, lastModified, thumbnailUrl, editorType, and version attributes are all metadata of the retrieved file. The document attribute contains a Node of type [DOCUMENT](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#document-props).\
\
The components key contains a mapping from node IDs to component metadata. This is to help you determine which components each instance comes from.

GET file nodes

Returns the nodes referenced to by :ids as a JSON object. The nodes are retrieved from the Figma file referenced to by :key.\
\
The node Id and file key can be parsed from any Figma node url: https://www.figma.com/file/:key/:title?node-id=:id.\
\
The name, lastModified, thumbnailUrl, editorType, and version attributes are all metadata of the specified file.\
\
The document attribute contains a Node of type [DOCUMENT](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#document-props).\
\
The components key contains a mapping from node IDs to component metadata. This is to help you determine which components each instance comes from.\
\
By default, no vector data is returned. To return vector data, pass the geometry=paths parameter to the endpoint.\
Each node can also inherit properties from applicable styles. The styles key contains a mapping from style IDs to style metadata.\
\
Important: the nodes map may contain values that are null . This may be due to the node id not existing within the specified file.

GET image

Renders images from a file.\
\
If no error occurs, "images" will be populated with a map from node IDs to URLs of the rendered images, and "status" will be omitted. The image assets will expire after 30 days.\
\
Important: the image map may contain values that are null. This indicates that rendering of that specific node has failed. This may be due to the node id not existing, or other reasons such has the node having no renderable components. It is guaranteed that any node that was requested for rendering will be represented in this map whether or not the render succeeded.

GET image fills

Returns download links for all images present in image fills in a document. Image fills are how Figma represents any user supplied images. When you drag an image into Figma, we create a rectangle with a single fill that represents the image, and the user is able to transform the rectangle (and properties on the fill) as they wish.\
\
This endpoint returns a mapping from image references to the URLs at which the images may be download. Image URLs will expire after no more than 14 days. Image references are located in the output of the [GET files](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#files-endpoint) endpoint under the imageRef attribute in a [Paint](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#paint-type).

CommentsFigma’s _Commenting mode_ allows users to leave comments directly on layers or objects on the canvas. This is useful for collaboration when you want to suggest an adjustment, provide feedback, or critique a specific object or layout. You can use the Figma API to access a whole host of information about a comment, from when the comment was made and by whom, to its exact location on the canvas.TypesThere are a number of different properties associated with a comment, that help to give us more context. The following is a list of all the properties a comment will have:

Version historyFigma allows you to distinguish different stages or Versions of a file, as the file evolves over time. This is all recorded in the Version history, which allows users to view, track and restore previous versions of a File.TypesFigma will record some basic information about the file, like the who and when, as well as allow the user to determine a title and description for the version. These form the basis of the properties associated with version history.

Webhooks V2Getting started

IMPORTANT: Webhooks V2 is still in open beta. Features and functions may change as we respond to feedback. Figma will attempt to keep APIs backwards compatible.

Webhooks allow you to observe when specific events happen in files. For example: a collaborator comments on a file, or you add a new version to a file's history.\
Using these events as triggers, you can build integrations with other applications. This can help to improve workflows, or extend the functionality of your design system.

Webhooks are attached to a specific team. All admins of that team can create and manage webhooks for the team. There is a limit of 20 webhooks per team. You can assign a certain event trigger to each webhook.

* Webhooks will notify for files that are available to everyone on the team, or are in[ view-only projects](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038512473).
* Webhooks will not notify for files in [invite-only projects.](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038512473)

Every payload (expect for PING) will contain the file name, file key and information related to the event triggered. This allows you to see which file triggered the event. Figma does not currently have an interface for webhooks. At the moment, you must create, modify, and delete webhooks through the webhooks API.

To get started with webhooks:\
\
Setup your local webserver and expose the endpoint\
Figma recommends using a tool similar to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose a public URL for your local webserver.\
\
Configure your server to handle POST requests with a JSON payload\
Your server should return the status code 200 OK when it receives a webhook request. If it returns another status code, or takes too long, the Figma API will treat this as an error. Figma retries failed requests 3 times with an exponential backoff strategy.

* The first retry occurs 5 minutes after the first failure.
* The second retry occurs 30 minutes after the second failure.
* The final retry occurs 3 hours after the third failure.

Figma does not currently deactivate endpoints with frequent errors.\
\
Create your webhook\
Use the [POST Webhook](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#webhooks-v2-post-endpoint) endpoint to attach a webhook to a team. You will need to be an admin of the team to create a webhook. If you are successful, you will receive a PING event. This means your webhook is working and will receive any updates.

If you are having problems with your webhook, you can query the[webhook requests endpoint](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#webhooks-v2-requests-endpoint). This will list all requests and responses within the past seven days.Events

| Event name          | Trigger condition                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PING                | Triggers when a webhook is created. Used for debugging. Cannot be subscribed to, all webhooks will recieve PING events.                                                                                        |
| FILE_UPDATE         | Triggers whenever a file saves. This occurs whenever a file is closed or within 30 seconds after changes have been made.                                                                                       |
| FILE_VERSION_UPDATE | Triggers whenever a named version is created in the version history of a file.                                                                                                                                 |
| FILE_DELETE         | Triggers whenever a file has been deleted. If you subscribe to FILE_UPDATE, you automatically get these notifications. Note that this does not trigger on all files within a folder, if the folder is deleted. |
| LIBRARY_PUBLISH     | Triggers whenever a library file is published.                                                                                                                                                                 |

EndpointsYou can use the following Webhooks via the Figma API:POST webhook

Create a new webhook which will call the specified endpoint when the event triggers. By default, this webhook will automatically send a PING event to the endpoint when it is created. If this behavior is not desired, you can create the webhook and set the status to PAUSED and reactivate it later.

Security

### Securing your webhook

IMPORTANT: When creating a webhook you are required to pass in a passcode. The purpose of the passcode field is so that your application can verify that Figma is actually what is calling your endpoint (as opposed to some attacker trying to make you believe something about your users' Figma files).

We would recommend comparing the passcode we pass back to you with the passcode originally provided when creating the endpoint to make sure they match before acting on the webhook trigger. If you receive a request with the wrong passcode, you should respond with a 400 Bad Request HTTP response which will immediately stop the webhook.Errors

This section outlines the common error codes and resolutions you may encounter while using the Figma API.

| Error code               | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400Bad request           | Parameters are invalid or malformed. Please check the input formats.                                                                                                    |
| 404Not found             | The requested file or resource was not found.                                                                                                                           |
| 429Rate limit            | In some cases API requests may be throttled or rate limited. Please wait a while before attempting the request again (typically a minute).                              |
| 500Internal server error | This most commonly occurs for very large image render requests, which may time out our server and return a 500. Please reduce the number and size of objects requested. |
