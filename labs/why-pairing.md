# Why Pairing?

## Why Pairing?

### What's Pair Programming?

**Pair programming** is a commonly used practice in the industry. Many companies strongly recommend or require their developers and data scientists to work out problems together as they continuously deliver software.

Pairing is also a technique directly correlated with Agile development workflows, and its benefits are often seen in the medium to long-term across development teams. Because the benefits of pairing aren't immediate, the practice has uneven adoption—but it's seen overall as a good thing!

However, we believe in Lambda School Labs that working in pairs directly correlates with your success as a learner, because:

* Pairing gives you an extra set of eyes on the code you're delivering—_even_ _before you submit a pull-request._ This allows the pair to work through features thoroughly.
* Pairing forces you to talk through your work—a vital skill for any beginner attempting to break into the industry.
* Pairing allows you to work slower in the short-term but catch mistakes before shipping them to production.

Pairing can be difficult to pull off correctly, and it can even be uncomfortable to have someone else looking over your shoulder while you work. Our hope is that you can benefit from the techniques laid out in this module as we ensure that you pair to ship tickets _at least 3 times_ throughout your labs journey.



## Pair Programming in Labs

It's **required** that you pair program to ship the tickets your team scopes for each sprint—_at least_ 3 occasions throughout your Labs journey. Your experience with these practices is vital to allow you space to articulate your approaches to software development.

**Pairing will force you to talk through the technical tasks at hand and prepare you for interviews by giving you practice talking through your work as an experienced software developer or data scientist.**

In each pull request you make, be sure to document the following:

* Who you paired with
* What pairing method(s) you used
* How did it go? What did you learn?
